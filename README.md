## Project description
● Overview of an industry, business or problem

The Colombian Association of Capital Cities - Asocapitales is a non-profit organization that aims to work in the preparation, consolidation and management of a common agenda built from the territories and consisting of issues of national, regional and local scope and interest. To achieve this purpose, the Association works mainly in the generation of spaces for dialogue, integration, coordination and collaboration between municipal and national authorities.

● Define the specific problem that should be solved

Law 617 of 2000 defined a limit to the operating expenses of territorial entities in order to generate a framework of fiscal responsibility. On the other hand, Law 2082 of 2021 defined a framework for the allocation of competencies, where the Fiscal Performance Index, which incorporates the results of the operating expenditure indicator defined by Law 617 of 2000, is taken as a starting point. 
In this sense, as of 2019 there were some territorial entities that did not comply with the operating expenditure limit. Additionally, the Fiscal Performance Index is published 5 months after the end of the year, so the information is not available quickly for decision-making in terms of expenditure execution of territorial entities.
In this sense, it is necessary to create a set of metrics to determine whether territorial entities are efficient in the execution of operating expenses.

● Why does this problem matter?

Achieving the construction of these metrics is important because it allows to determine the efficiency in the execution of operating expenses for territorial entities and to have timely information for decision-making by the authorities. Greater efficiency allows more resources to be available for investment in the cities and to comply with the indicators established by law.
